			"taskTitle": "Initialize Monorepo and CI/CD Pipeline",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Initialize Monorepo and CI/CD Pipeline' into 5 detailed subtasks outlining steps to create the monorepo structure (frontend/, backend/, infra/), add Dockerfile templates for each service, configure GitHub Actions workflows for linting, unit tests, and Docker build/push, and write the initial README with development guidelines.",
			"reasoning": "Setting up a monorepo and basic CI/CD workflows is straightforward but involves multiple configuration steps."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Configure Infrastructure as Code",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Configure Infrastructure as Code' into 6 detailed subtasks covering creation of Terraform modules or CloudFormation templates, definition of ECS cluster on Fargate, RDS PostgreSQL instance, S3 buckets, Redis ElastiCache, IAM roles and policies, and remote state configuration for staging and production.",
			"reasoning": "Defining and provisioning multiple AWS resources with IaC and remote state management increases complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Backend Framework and LLM Integration",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Setup Backend Framework and LLM Integration' into 5 detailed subtasks including scaffolding the FastAPI project, installing dependencies (fastapi, uvicorn, langchain, openai, anthropic), implementing the AgentService class with prompt templates, configuring environment variables for API keys, and adding basic healthcheck endpoints.",
			"reasoning": "Combining API framework setup with LLM integration and custom agent logic adds moderate complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Design and Implement Data Models and Persistence Layer",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Design and Implement Data Models and Persistence Layer' into 6 detailed subtasks covering SQLAlchemy model definitions for TestCase, ExecutionResult, UserFeedback; Alembic migration setup; PostgreSQL connection configuration; Redis client integration; S3 artifact upload integration via boto3; and writing CRUD unit tests.",
			"reasoning": "Involves database schema design, migrations, caching, and external storage integration."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Develop CLI Tool for Natural Language Test Generation",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Develop CLI Tool for Natural Language Test Generation' into 4 detailed subtasks: CLI scaffold with Click or argparse, command definitions (generate --input, --format), integration with AgentService for test generation, and output formatting with stdout/file options plus unit tests.",
			"reasoning": "Building a Python CLI with argument parsing and service integration is moderate in complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Slackbot Integration for UAT Copilot",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Implement Slackbot Integration for UAT Copilot' into 5 detailed subtasks: setup of Slack app and Bolt SDK, slash command (/testpilot) handler implementation, request signature verification, FastAPI endpoint integration, and formatting rich interactive messages with attachments and buttons.",
			"reasoning": "Handling Slack events, security checks, interactive messages, and backend calls adds multiple integration points."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Playwright-based Test Execution Engine",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Develop Playwright-based Test Execution Engine' into 6 detailed subtasks: scaffold the execution module, configure Docker container or Lambda deployment, implement parameter handling for test code and settings, add retry and timeout logic, capture screenshots and console logs on failures, and write integration tests with sample scripts.",
			"reasoning": "Requires orchestration of headless browser execution, containerization, retries, and artifact collection."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Create FastAPI Endpoints for Test Generation and Execution",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Create FastAPI Endpoints for Test Generation and Execution' into 5 detailed subtasks: define POST /generate and POST /execute endpoints, implement GET /results/{id}, create Pydantic request/response schemas, add authentication middleware, and write pytest/httpx tests with mocks for AgentService and ExecutionEngine.",
			"reasoning": "Designing multiple endpoints with validation, authentication, and service isolation testing is moderately complex."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Artifact Storage and Reporting Mechanism",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Implement Artifact Storage and Reporting Mechanism' into 5 detailed subtasks: implement S3 upload logic for screenshots/logs, update ExecutionResult records with URLs, trigger Slack or CLI notifications on completion, add retry and error logging for uploads, and write end-to-end tests with mocked S3 and notification services.",
			"reasoning": "Combines external storage, database updates, notification triggers, and error handling."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Build React Dashboard with Human-in-the-Loop Feedback",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Build React Dashboard with Human-in-the-Loop Feedback' into 7 detailed subtasks: scaffold React/Next.js app, implement Test Management list view, create Test Detail page with Monaco editor, build feedback submission form, integrate with /feedback API, add real-time status updates via WebSocket or polling, and write Jest and Playwright tests for UI flows.",
			"reasoning": "Front-end complexity includes dynamic UIs, code editor integration, real-time updates, and end-to-end testing."
